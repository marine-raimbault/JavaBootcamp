## Getting Started
Welcome here! 😊

This is the code for my video: [Java Bootcamp Express 🚀: Learn Java in 12 Minutes!](https://youtu.be/xIPODmdMp-8);

It contains my summary of a 2-week intensive Java bootcamp (MATSE Java Blockkurs) 🚀📚

*Many of the functions are currently commented out. In most IDEs, you can quickly uncomment multiple lines of code by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + forward slash (/). 🧑‍💻*

Enjoy! 🎉👍

# Index:

- 1- Basic Concepts (Comments, Datatypes, Casting, Input/Output)

## Folder Structure (Specific to Visual Studio Code)

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
